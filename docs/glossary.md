| **Figma Account**         | A user account required to access Figma's design and collaboration tools.                                   |
| **Group**                 | The process of combining multiple elements into a single unit in Figma for easier manipulation and organization. |
| **Hand Tool**             | A tool used to pan and move the workspace view by dragging the mouse or touchpad.                             |
| **Move Tool**             | A tool in Figma used to reposition elements within the workspace.                                             |
| **Page**                  | A section within a Figma file where different frames or artboards can be created and organized.              |
| **Properties Panel**      | A panel that allows users to adjust the properties of selected design elements, such as colors, sizes, and effects. |
| **Prototype**             | An interactive model of a design that demonstrates how users will interact with the application.              |
| **Prototype Link**        | A connection between two frames in a prototype that allows navigation between different screens.              |
| **Prototype Tab**         | The section in Figma's workspace where users can define interactions, links, and transitions between frames.   |
| **Rectangle Tool**        | A tool in Figma used to draw rectangles in the workspace.                                                     |
| **Scale Tool**            | A tool in Figma used to resize selected elements by dragging the corners.                                    |
