| Figma is not loading                       | Internet connection issues                                            | Ensure you have a stable internet connection. Refresh your browser or restart the application if necessary.                                                              |
| You cannot access your project file       | The file was moved or deleted                                        | Check if the file was accidentally moved to a different folder. If you cannot find the file, check the trash or reach out to your team members if it's a shared project.  |
| Unable to select objects                  | Your selection tool is not active                                    | Make sure you're using the correct tool (Move Tool or Selection Tool). You can also try pressing `V` to switch to the Move Tool.                                         |
| Figma is running slow or freezing         | Your browser's cache is full or Figma's resources are overloaded     | Clear your browser cache, close unnecessary browser tabs, or restart your computer. If issues persist, try using Figma's desktop app.                                    |
| Unable to see all design elements         | Layers or objects are hidden in the Layers Panel                     | Open the Layers Panel and ensure that all relevant layers are visible (uncheck the eye icon next to each layer to toggle visibility).                                      |
| Components are not updating               | Components were not properly linked or synchronized                 | Check if the component instances are properly linked to the main component. If not, re-link or update them from the Assets panel.                                        |
| Prototype links are not working           | The prototype links are not properly configured                      | Double-check your prototype links in the Prototype tab to ensure that the interactions are set correctly. Make sure you’ve selected the correct trigger and action.         |
| Figma does not reflect changes in real time| You're working offline or the sync feature is delayed                | Check your internet connection. If working offline, Figma may not sync your changes until you're connected. Ensure that sync is complete in the top right corner.          |
| Figma toolbar is missing or broken        | Browser compatibility issue or a corrupted session                   | Try restarting Figma or clearing your browser cache. If you're using the web app, ensure you’re using a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).                         |
| Cannot zoom in or out properly            | Mouse or trackpad settings may be interfering with zoom functionality| Check your mouse settings or try using keyboard shortcuts (`Ctrl +` or `Ctrl -` on Windows, `Cmd +` or `Cmd -` on Mac).                                                    |
| Unable to create a new frame              | You have not selected the frame tool                                 | Ensure you’ve selected the Frame tool from the toolbar. If the tool is missing, try switching to the Frame tool by clicking on the drop-down next to the shape tool.        |
| Figma freezes when opening a file         | The file is too large or has too many elements                       | Try opening the file in Figma's desktop app, which might handle large files better. You can also try splitting the design into multiple files to reduce load times.        |
