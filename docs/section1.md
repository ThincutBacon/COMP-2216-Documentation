# Set Up Project 

## Overview

To begin with, lets start by showing you how to create your new team and create a new project file that you will be working in. Moving forward, we will be working within the project file you set up in this step.

!!! warning "Figma Account"
    As we stated in the introduction, we expect you have already created a your Figma account. If you have not, please go [**Sign-Up**](https://www.figma.com/login?is_not_gen_0=true&resource_type=team#) before you continue on with this guide.


## Login to your Figma dashboard

First off, go to [Figma.com](https://www.figma.com/login?is_not_gen_0=true&resource_type=team#) and **Login**. Logging in should immediately redirect you to your dashboard.

!!! success "Figma Dashboard"
    You should be seeing the following:  
    ![User dashboard](./images/newdashboard.png "User dashboard"){.center_image}  

## Create your team

!!! warning "Recommended Step"
    If you plan on working with a team, we recommend you to do the following steps. However, if you do not plan on working within a team, you may skip this step. Regardless, you will be able to invite collaborators into your project and move your file into a team later on. 

A team allows you to share any and all projects with your team members as long as it exists within the team folder. This is useful if you plan on sharing multiple projects with the same people.

To create a new team, look to the left-hand side of your screen and **Click** [Username's team] → [+ Create new]. 

!!! info "Teams Selection Dropdown"
    If you are struggling to find the drop-down menu, see the following:
    ![Team selection dropdown](./images/newteam.png "Team selection dropdown"){.center_image}  

1. After you click [+ Create new], you will be redirected to the Step 1 of the team creation page. Simply **Type** in your team name and **Click** [Create Team] to go to Step 2.

2. In Step 2, you will be able to add the email addresses of your collaborators. If you do not have anyone to add at the moment, simple **Click** [Skip for now]. Otherwise, **Type** in however many emails and **Click** [Continue] to move onto Step 3.

3. In Step 3 you will be asked to choose your team plan. We will be selecting the free Starter plan. **Click** [Choose Starter] and finish making your team.


!!! success "New Team Folder"
    After creating your team, you should be redirected to the following page.  
    ![Team dashboard](./images/teamdashboard.png "Team dashboard"){.center_image}    
    You are able to edit your team settings anytime by clicking on the dropdown next to your team name and selecting [View settings].  
    You can also invite more into your team by clicking on [Share].


## Create Your New Project File

FInally, we will be creating a new Figma Design file.

!!! info "Create File in Team Folder"
    If have done the previous step and are currently within your team dashboard, simple **Double Click** on the [Team Project] folder. From there you should be able to locate the [+ Create] button and do the following.

In your dashboard, locate and **Click** [+ Create] → [Design file]. Doing so will create and redirect you to your new file.  
![Create file](./images/createfile.png "Create file"){.center_image}  


## Take a Look

Now that you have successfully created your new project, let's first take a look around. You should be able to see the following:  

![Design workspace](./images/designworkspace.png "Design workspace"){.center_image}  

1. The Toolbar (Bottom Bar)  
2. Your Pages and Layers (Left Panel)  
3. The Design and Prototype Tabs (Right Panel)  
4. The Figma Logo Dropdown (Top-Right Corner)  
5. The Share Button (Top-Left Corner)  

!!! info "Going Back to Your Dashboard"
    ![Back to files](./images/backtofiles.png "Back to files"){.center_image}
    To go back to your dashboard, **Click** the [Figma Logo] → [Back to files].  
    If you become lost in trying to locate your project file again, simple navigate to your [All projects] tab from the left panel of your dashboard.


## Set Up Your Frame

As your last step, let's set up your frame in order to begin designing on Figma.

!!! info "Frames"
    A frame acts as a container for all the elements visible to the user during the Prototyping stage. It acts as a stand-in for a display screen (A phone screen, desktop monitor, etc.). Each separate frame will act as a different page/screen when prototyping (we will expand on this later).

Let's select the frame you will be using.

First **Navigate** to your toolbar and **Click** on the frame tool.

!!! info "Frame Not Found"
    If the frame tool is not immediately visible, you may have the section tool or slice tool currently selected.  
    To find the frame tool, please look at the image below.
    ![Frame tool group](./images/frametool.png "Frame tool group"){.center_image}

Once you have selected the frame tool, look to the the panel on your right. You should see a list of different devices available to you. To apply a frame, select the device type of your choosing and simply **Click and Drag** it onto the center work place.

!!! success "New Frame"
    Your work space should look like the following:  
    ![New frame in work space](./images/newframe.png "New frame in work space"){.center_image}  
    In this documentation, we will be using the "iPhone 16" frame.


## Conclusion

By the end of this section you will have successfully learned to:  

* Create a new team.  
* Create a new project file.  
* Set-up your frame.  

Great work!
