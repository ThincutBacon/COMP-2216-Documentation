Refresh your browser or restart the application if necessary. You cannot access your project file The file was moved or deleted Check if the file was accidentally moved to a different folder. If you cannot find the file, check the trash or reach out to your team members if it's a shared project. Unable to select objects Your selection tool is not active Make sure you're using the correct tool (Move Tool or Selection Tool). You can also try pressing <code>V</code> to switch to the Move Tool. Figma is running slow or freezing Your browser's cache is full or Figma's resources are overloaded Clear your browser cache, close unnecessary browser tabs, or restart your computer. If issues persist, try using Figma's desktop app. Unable to see all design elements Layers or objects are hidden in the Layers Panel Open the Layers Panel and ensure that all relevant layers are visible (uncheck the eye icon next to each layer to toggle visibility). Components are not updating Components were not properly linked or synchronized Check if the component instances are properly linked to the main component. If not, re-link or update them from the Assets panel. Prototype links are not working The prototype links are not properly configured Double-check your prototype links in the Prototype tab to ensure that the interactions are set correctly. Make sure you\u2019ve selected the correct trigger and action. Figma does not reflect changes in real time You're working offline or the sync feature is delayed Check your internet connection. If working offline, Figma may not sync your changes until you're connected. Ensure that sync is complete in the top right corner. Figma toolbar is missing or broken Browser compatibility issue or a corrupted session Try restarting Figma or clearing your browser cache. If you're using the web app, ensure you\u2019re using a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.). Cannot zoom in or out properly Mouse or trackpad settings may be interfering with zoom functionality Check your mouse settings or try using keyboard shortcuts (<code>Ctrl +</code> or <code>Ctrl -</code> on Windows, <code>Cmd +</code> or <code>Cmd -</code> on Mac). Unable to create a new frame You have not selected the frame tool Ensure you\u2019ve selected the Frame tool from the toolbar. If the tool is missing, try switching to the Frame tool by clicking on the drop-down next to the shape tool. Figma freezes when opening a file The file is too large or has too many elements Try opening the file in Figma's desktop app, which might handle large files better. You can also try splitting the design into multiple files to reduce load times."}]}
